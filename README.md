# DeepLearning-CNN-Image-Classifier-
Using Convolutional Neural Networks to classify the images of dogs and cats.
In this Image classifier I trained the model giving 8000 images containing images of cats and dogs used and tested the model with 2000 images and
acheived great results using two hidden layers fully connected and stochastic gradient descent for back propagation to achieve higher accuracy.
